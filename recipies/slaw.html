        <p>Our grandfather was a preacher, so when we were growing up, the whole family would often join the community for all-day church singing and dinner on the grounds. There was almost always a table covered with food, including bowls of coleslaw. Each one tasted different, because every cook used their own special ingredient. This is ours, and it is full of colorsâ€”purple and green and red. It's got everything!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium head red cabbage, chopped (10 cups)</li>
            <li>1 medium green bell pepper, seeded and chopped (1 cup)</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped (1 cup)</li>
            <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 large tomato, chopped (1 3/4 cups)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now follow these simple steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine cabbage, green pepper, and onion in a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, vinegar, powdered sugar, salt, and black pepper until smooth. Pour dressing over vegetables, tossing well to combine. Cover and chill at least 2 hours to allow everything to marinate.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, gently stir in tomato and season to taste with additional salt and pepper. (Chill, covered, up to 5 days.)</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
